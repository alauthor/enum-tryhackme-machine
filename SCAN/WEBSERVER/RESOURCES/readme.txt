What is TWiki?
--------------

TWiki is a flexible and powerful web-based collaboration 
platform that allows you to run a dynamic intranet site, a 
project development space, a document management system, a 
knowledge base, an issue tracking system and many other 
groupware application. TWiki looks and feels like a normal 
intranet or Web site. Users can freely change or create 
content from any Web browser, without requiring special 
browser plugins. 

Major companies like Sun Microsystems, Motorola, Inktomi 
and SAP depend on the TWiki platform to increase the
productivity of their engineering teams. 

Features include automatic link generation, full text 
search, authorization based on groups, Web form handling, 
email notification of changes, file attachments to Web 
pages, revision control of pages and attachments, and 
more. The server-side TWiki Plugins API provides developers 
with a simple way to build new groupware applications. 

The GPLed TWiki software and over 60 Plugins can be 
downloaded from the TWiki.org web site, http://TWiki.org/.

A side note in case you intend to use TWiki on your Intranet:
TWiki is successfully deployed as a collaboration tool and
dynamic Intranet tool at many major companies. You need to 
consider some important points to reach that goal. Do not 
underestimate the initial effort it takes to get a 
collaboration tool accepted within the company. Support from 
upper management is a must. A company with a culture that 
encourages information sharing is much more likely to succeed 
than one where information hoarding is the norm. There is 
also an initial catch 22 problem if you intend to use it as a 
knowledge base: "Why should I use the tool, there is so 
little information in it". An incentive program to reward 
contributions, and a dedicated knowledge engineer can help in 
the initial phase of deployment.

Good luck with your collaboration effort and with TWiki.
Happy collaboration and twiki'ing.
